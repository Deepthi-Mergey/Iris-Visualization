# Iris-Visualization
Iris Visualization through Seaborn and Matplotlib.
Checked for any missing values.
Frequency of the three species in the Iris Dataset is plotted using Bar plot.
Visualize and analyse the relationship between two variables x = 'SepalLengthCm', y = 'SepalWidthCm' and describe their individual distributions on the same plot using Joint plot.
Statistical summary of the features being plotted using Box plot.
Visualization that displays the distribution of a continuous variable with the points jittered so they do not overlap using Strip plot.
Visualize the distribution of data and its probability distribution using Violin plot.
Matrix of graphs that enables the visualization of the relationship between each pair of variables in a dataset using Pair plot.
Finding the correlation between different features in the dataset using Heat Map.
Comparing range and distribution of groups having numerical data using Distribution plot like hist and dist.
Each data point is clearly visible and no data obscured by overplotting using Swarm plot.
Simple line on a 2 Dimensional plane using lmplot.
Range of Sepal Length for the three different Species of Iris Flower using Stacked Histogram plot.
Visual representation of Various dimensions of Iris flower and their range in dataset using Area plot.
